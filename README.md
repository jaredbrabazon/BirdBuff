# BirdBuff
 **BirdBuff** is an interactive Shiny App for studying birds through **audio** and **photo** submissions. I made it as a hobby shiny app to test out using {shinyMobile}. Use an eBird API to help study birds all around the world and get ready for your next trip. It isn't perfect, but can be a nice go to app on your phone to get some studying in instead of scrolling social media!

## ‚ú® Features

- **SQLITE Back End:**  
  The app is powered on the backend by an **SQLite database** containing links to five-star audio and photo submissions for *every bird species documented* worldwide (at least those with available data on Macaulay Library). The data used in the app were retrieved directly from the [Cornell Macaulay Library](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/) and include URLs for listening and viewing.
  
- **eBird API Integration:**  
Users can **enter their eBird API token** (instructions provided in-app for getting a token).  

- *BirdBuff works without an API token, but supplying one unlocks recent siting data and enhanced location-based features.*

- **Location-Based Exploration:**  
Select **any location** and view the audio and image highlights of *recent bird sitings*.  
- Expand your birding knowledge with verified multimedia.
